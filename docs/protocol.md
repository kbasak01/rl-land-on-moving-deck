## Phase 0

### P0-D1 — Pinned dependencies (2026-09-21)

*Decision.* The environment is pinned exactly, `deck-motion-forecast`'s resolved set is reused
verbatim where it overlaps, and both third-party projects are installed editable from pinned
submodules.

- deck-motion-forecast submodule SHA: `e9fa15cc35312a5c1ecf0c42668a690b5061c090`
- gym-pybullet-drones submodule SHA: `7ebad1ecabd28a7000add2d05f888aa2e837c2cc`
- Resolved pins (this project's own; the dmf-shared block is in `pyproject.toml`):
  gymnasium **1.3.0**, stable-baselines3 **2.9.0**, pybullet **3.2.7** (sdist build),
  rliable **1.2.0**, tensorboard **2.21.0**, imageio **2.37.4** + imageio-ffmpeg **0.6.0**.
  `optuna` is deliberately *not* installed; it sits in an optional `tune` extra because no
  committed result depends on it (plan §4 calls it optional).
- Inherited from dmf unchanged: numpy 2.5.2, scipy 1.18.1, pandas 3.0.5, pyarrow 25.0.1,
  pyyaml 6.0.3, torch 2.13.0, onnx 1.22.0, onnxruntime-gpu 1.29.0, tensorrt-cu13 10.16.1.11,
  matplotlib 3.11.1, rich 15.0.0, tqdm 4.70.0; dev: pytest 9.1.1, pytest-cov 7.1.0, ruff 0.16.4,
  mypy 2.3.1, types-PyYAML, pandas-stubs.
- Machine: Python 3.12.3, Ubuntu/WSL2 (kernel 6.6.114.1), Intel i9-10980XE (36 logical cores),
  62 GB RAM, RTX A4000 driver 596.71, gcc 13.3.0. `torch` resolved to **2.13.0+cu130** from the
  default PyPI index and `torch.cuda.is_available()` is True, matching dmf's reference machine.

*Evidence / notes.*

1. **pybullet built from sdist, as predicted.** No cp312 wheel exists; pip downloaded
   `pybullet-3.2.7.tar.gz` (80.5 MB) and produced
   `pybullet-3.2.7-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl` (99 MB) locally, now in pip's wheel cache.
   `build-essential` and `python3.12-dev` were already present. The whole three-package
   editable install took under 5 minutes end to end on a cold pip cache.
2. **rliable co-installs cleanly** with `numpy==2.5.2` / `pandas==3.0.5`, pulling arch 7.2.0,
   statsmodels 0.15.0, formulaic, patsy, seaborn and absl-py. No dmf pin had to be relaxed, so
   the contingency planned for Phase 0 (moving rliable to an optional extra) was not needed and
   CLAUDE.md non-negotiable 5 stands as written.
3. **Editable install verified functionally, not just by import.** `tests/test_smoke.py` runs
   `dmf.sim.generate.simulate_realization` on one frigate SS5 spec; `dmf` resolves
   `configs/sim/vessels` via `Path(__file__).parents[3]`, so that call passes only from an
   editable install. Likewise `pybullet` is checked by opening a DIRECT client and stepping it,
   not by `import pybullet` alone — an sdist build can import and fail to link.
4. **Layout note.** The Phase 0 throughput logic lives in `src/rld/bench/throughput.py` with
   `scripts/env_throughput.py` as its argparse wrapper. Plan §3 does not list a `bench/` package;
   it lists `deploy/bench.py` for Phase 8, which is a different measurement (policy inference
   latency, for H5). Keeping them apart avoids a Phase 8 collision.

### P0-D2 — Environment throughput and what it does and does not say (2026-09-21)

*Decision.* `results/env_throughput.csv` is the Phase 0 measurement that Phase 5's budget in P3-D1
will be sized from. The Phase 5 budget must be read from the **`vel` rows**, not the `rpm` rows.

*Measurement.* `HoverAviary` (cf2x, DIRECT/headless, pyb 240 Hz, ctrl 30 Hz), random actions,
20 000 timed environment steps per row after a 50-vector-step warmup, `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`,
36 logical cores. A *step* is one control tick of one drone, so a 16-worker vector step is 16 steps.

| backend | n_envs | act | steps/s | per env | steps/episode | h per 10 M steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DummyVecEnv   | 1  | rpm | 512  | 512  | 13.5  | 5.42 |
| SubprocVecEnv | 1  | rpm | 402  | 402  | 13.5  | 6.91 |
| SubprocVecEnv | 8  | rpm | 678  | 85   | 14.6  | 4.10 |
| SubprocVecEnv | 16 | rpm | 831  | 52   | 13.9  | 3.34 |
| DummyVecEnv   | 1  | vel | 1175 | 1175 | 243.9 | 2.36 |
| SubprocVecEnv | 1  | vel | 789  | 789  | 243.9 | 3.52 |
| SubprocVecEnv | 8  | vel | 4956 | 620  | 250.0 | 0.56 |
| SubprocVecEnv | 16 | vel | 7575 | 473  | 250.0 | **0.37** |

*Reason the `vel` rows are the ones to use.* The first run of this measurement showed `vel`
roughly twice as fast as `rpm`, which is backwards: `vel` adds a `DSLPIDControl` inner loop at the
physics rate. Counting episode boundaries explains it, and the counts are now a committed column.
Under a **random** policy a random RPM vector tumbles the Crazyflie out of bounds in about 14
steps, so the `rpm` rows spend most of their wall clock in `reset`, reloading the drone URDF; the
`vel` rows run ~244 steps, essentially to `EPISODE_LEN_SEC`. The `rpm` rows therefore measure how
fast a random policy crashes, not what an action space costs, and their near-flat scaling
(402 → 831 steps/s for 16× the workers) is reset serialisation, not step cost. The `vel` rows scale
789 → 7575 steps/s, 9.6× on 16 workers, and their episode length is the right order for a landing
episode (≤ 12 s model time at 30 Hz = 360 steps).

*What this number does not cover.* It is environment stepping only — no policy forward pass, no
PPO update, no `VecNormalize`. And it is `HoverAviary`, not the Phase 2 landing environment, which
adds a second PyBullet body (the deck), a constraint driven every physics step, and the deck-motion
bridge evaluation. Phase 2 must re-measure before P3-D1 fixes the budget; this row is the ceiling,
not the estimate. Recorded as the ceiling deliberately: 10 M steps at 7575 steps/s is 0.37 h of
stepping, so a 5-seed PPO sweep is not compute-bound at Phase 0's best case, and any budget
argument in P3-D1 that claims otherwise has to explain what got slower.
